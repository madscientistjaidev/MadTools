# MadTools
A small collection of tools that I have made over the years to support projects that I have done.

The code should work in Java 10 and greater, and is provided without any guarantees of completeness or correctness. It is not production quality, and is intended solely for casual use.

The code is provided free of any license and/or other restrictions.

Any feedback and bug reports are appreciated.

The sorting algorithms take a compareTo function in an anonymous inner class.
