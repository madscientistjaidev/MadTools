# MadTools
A small collection of tools that I have made over the years to support projects that I have done.

The code should work in Java 8+, and is provided without any guarantees of completeness or correctness. It is not production quality, and is intended for academic use.

The code is provided free of any license restrictions. Use it as you please.

Any feedback and bug reports are appreciated.
